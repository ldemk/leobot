Omnidirectional_Rig
====================

awesome ROS package that include :

  - a class OmniCamera -> handle an Omnidirectional Camera
  - a class OmniCameraRig -> handle a Rig of Omnidirectional Cameras
  - a class SingleImageHandler -> handle image from a single ROS topic
  - a class SyncImageHandler -> handle image from multiple ROS topics in a synchronized way (so far limited to 2 topics)

  - demo of interfacing OmniCameraRig with Oculus Rift (through sensor_msgs::PointCloud + rviz)
  - demo of panoramic view from OmniCameraRig
